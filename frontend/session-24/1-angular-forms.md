## Why Not Just Use Normal HTML Forms?
Normal HTML forms can collect data, but they are limited in dynamic.


- **On Submit** - It reloads the page by making an http request, this restarts the angular app.
- **No Automatic Binding** – You must manually read/write values from inputs to JS variables.
- **Manual Validation** – Complex validation requires extra JavaScript code.
- **No State Tracking** – HTML can’t track states like touched, dirty, or valid.
- **Poor API Integration** – Sending/receiving data requires more boilerplate.
- **No Reactive Updates** – You need extra event listeners for real-time UI updates.

Angular Forms solve these problems with **two-way binding, built-in validation, and automatic state management**.

## Why We Need Angular Forms
- **Data Binding** – Sync input fields with component variables using `[(ngModel)]`.
- **Validation** – Built-in and custom validators ensure data correctness.
- **State Tracking** – Tracks touched, dirty, and validity status automatically.
- **Better UX** – Show instant validation feedback without reloading.
- **Integration** – Works easily with services and APIs.
